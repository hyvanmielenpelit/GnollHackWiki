These are instructions on live streaming GnollHack games on Twitch or YouTube.

## Twitch Settings

In Twitch, you need to enable **Store past broadcasts** in Account Settings -> Channel and Videos. Otherwise, Twitch does not save your streams for later watching.

## YouTube Settings

In YouTube, please make sure that your account is activated for live streaming by visiting “Go Live” under the “+ video camera” icon. It may take **up to 24 hours that your account is activated for live streaming**.
Remember that **you should not stream more than 12 hours in one go**. If you do, the stream will not be archived. You should rather divide your games into shorter streams.

You must **Enable DVR** in the additional settings of your stream so that YouTube saves your live stream.
