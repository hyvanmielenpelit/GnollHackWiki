## Rebuilding Solution

Use **Build → Rebuild Solution**.

## If Rebuilding Fails

You can try:

- Rebuilding the solution again.
- Building/rebuilding the projects that failed individually and then rebuilding the solution again.
- Check if the build complains about missing files and see in GitHub changes if they are deleted. If yes, then undo deletions.
- Running **Build → Run Code Analysis on Solution**.
