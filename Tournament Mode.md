You can activate Tournament Mode in the settings *(modern ports only)*. It is meant to be used in tournaments for forcing settings necessary to take part in the tournaments and as extra safeguards against cheating.

It also tries to emulate the environment which players have when playing on [[public Linux servers|Public Servers]], for maximum equivalence with Linux server play. Therefore it forces on settings like [[Allow Ghost Levels|Settings#allow-ghost-levels]] and [[Share Bones Files|Settings#share-bones-files]].

## Game Mode

Tournament Mode allows games to be played only in [[Classic Mode]]:

- Permadeath
- Save files can be loaded only once

## Game Difficulty

Games can only be played at [[/Difficulties/Expert]] difficulty or higher.

Expert difficulty is an unadjusted difficulty, which is considered to be comparable to NetHack difficulty.

## Settings

Tournament Mode forces on the following settings:

- [[Post Game Progress|Settings#post-game-progress]]
- [[Post Top Scores|Settings#post-top-scores]]
- [[Allow Ghost Levels|Settings#allow-ghost-levels]]
- [[Share Bones Files|Settings#share-bones-files]]
- [[Save File Tracking]]
- [[Record Game|Settings#record-game]]
- [[Auto-Upload To Cloud|Settings#auto-upload-to-cloud]]

Tournament Mode also disables all custom links and webhooks in the [[Server Posting|Settings#server-posting]] section.

You also need to have a registered [[GnollHack Account]] and have entered your username and password to the respective fields.

## GnollHack Account Server

On the GnollHack Account server, in [recent games](https://account.gnollhack.com/RecentGames) and [top scores](https://account.gnollhack.com/TopScores), games played in Tournament Mode display **Tournament** along with the game difficulty and the game mode.

## Junethack

For taking part in [[Junethack]], you need also to register your Junethack username to [[GnollHack Account]].
