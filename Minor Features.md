## General

* Players can become slowed, which reduces their speed to 2/3 of their base speed (usually to 8) and negates the fast and very fast intrinsics and extrinsics. So, one's speed can end up being reduced from 20 (very fast) to 8, which is effectively -60% to speed.
* Using 'Shift + Direction' to run no longer enters known traps.
* Finding secret doors with bad luck (-3 or lower) is now actually possible.

## Difficulty Levels â€” Minor Effects

* On easier difficulty levels (under Veteran), you start with a greater number of **scrolls of identify** (4/3/2 on Standard/Experienced/Adept). 
* On easier difficulty levels (especially Standard), **manuals** appear in the game, which describe some of the game mechanics.
* The **elven bard** has a greater chance of appearing in the game on easier difficulty levels (she tells about Elbereth).
* The characters may get a starting **wand of probing** on easier difficulty levels (it can also reveal corpse statistics in GnollHack).

## Role Changes
