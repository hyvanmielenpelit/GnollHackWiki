There are four types of elemental enchantments in GnollHack:

* Fire enchantment — 4d6 fire damage upon hit.
* Lightning enchantment — 6d6 electrical damage upon hit.
* Cold enchantment — 12d6 cold damage upon hit.
* Death enchantment — Slays the target upon hit. Can be applied only on bone or glass weapons.

All elemental enchantments dissipate upon successful hit for ammo, thrown weapons, and stackable weapons. For other types of weapons, elemental enchantments have a 20% chance of dissipating.
