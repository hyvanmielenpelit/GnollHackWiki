## Restriction

Being illiterate means that you do not read or write anything - this includes scrolls, spellbooks and even fortune cookie messages and t-shirts. Using a magic marker to write a scroll or spellbook, or engraving anything but an X or x, also breaks this conduct. Reading random engravings you may encounter on the floor does not break this conduct.
