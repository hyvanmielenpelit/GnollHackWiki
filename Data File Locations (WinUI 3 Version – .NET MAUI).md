## Data File Locations by Game Version

On Windows, the game stores data files to the following locations depending on the game version:

| Game Version | Data File Location |
| :----------- | :------------------|
| Steam | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Hyvän mielen pelit ry\Hyvnmielenpelitry.889864DD5340.Steam\Data` |
| Steam Playtest | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Hyvän mielen pelit ry\Hyvnmielenpelitry.889864DD5340.Playtest\Data` |
| MSIX (GitHub) | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Hyvnmielenpelitry.889864DD5340.NoStore_[id]\LocalState` |

## Random ID in MSIX Package

Note that if you have installed the game with the MSIX package, you need to check what `[id]` is by visiting `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages` first. It's a random ID, such as `xg5r138e1vwac`.

## Quick Access to Data File Location

1. Press `Win+R`.
2. Type or copy-paste the data file location in the text box.
