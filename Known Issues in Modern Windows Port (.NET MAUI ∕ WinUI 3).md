## In the full screen mode, 32 pixels near the top of the game screen have a wrong cursor and does not respond to mouse clicks

This is a bug in .NET MAUI 9.0. Microsoft needs to fix it.

The same bug causes the top 32 or 64 pixels to have a wrong cursor in the game screen, when you switch the game between different displays with _Win+Shift+Left/Right_.

- They probably don't recognize GnollHack as a game.
- When they used the work in the past, they caused graphical glitches, and thus it may be that Valve and NVIDIA disabled these overlays for GnollHack.
