## Enabling Bones Sharing

After you have registered a [[GnollHack Account]], you can enable **Share Bones Files** in the settings. This will share your dead characters with others with some probability. It will also download other people's bones files for you with some probability. Bones files are uploaded and downloaded whenever your character dies.

## What is a Bones File?

A **bones file** is a dungeon level where a character died. More info here: https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Bones

Bones files are generated and downloaded only if you play the game in the **Classic mode**. They are also separated by the difficulty and game version compatibility, so that the downloaded bones files are always compatible with the version of the game you are playing and are in the same difficulty level.
