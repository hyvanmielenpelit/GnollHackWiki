## Selecting 7, 8, or 9 items


### Problem


In some menus, 7 selects art objects, 8 selects miscellaneous magic items, and 9 selects reagents.


### Question


How do I select 7, 8, or 9 items without selecting the above mentioned item groups?


### Solution


You can press # first to start counting if there are art objects (7), miscellaneous magic items (8) or reagents (9) in a multiselect menu, such as drop all item types menu, which would fire the object class selection instead of triggering counting upon pressing these numbers as the first character.
