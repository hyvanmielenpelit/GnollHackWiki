There are two toggles in the mobile user interface that control in what mode you will play your game:
1. **Classic Mode toggle**
    - **Off:** Character resurrects at the starting altar or another checkpoint upon dying
    - **On:** Character dies permanently
2. **Casual Mode toggle**
    - **Off:** Saved games are deleted upon loading *(cannot load saved games multiple times)*
    - **On:** Saved games are *not* deleted upon loading *(can load saved games multiple times)*

Thus, there are four different gameplay modes in the mobile version of the game. They are named as follows:

1. **[[Modern Mode]] (M)** 
    - **Classic Mode toggle:** Off
    - **Casual Mode toggle:** Off
2. **[[Classic Mode]]**
    - **Classic Mode toggle:** On
    - **Casual Mode toggle:** Off
3. **[[Casual Mode]] (C)**
    - **Classic Mode toggle:** Off
    - **Casual Mode toggle:** On
4. **[[Casual-Classic Mode]] (or Reloadable Mode) (R)**
    - **Classic Mode toggle:** On
    - **Casual Mode toggle:** On

Additionally, one can also activate **[[Wizard Mode]] (W)** for debugging purposes.
