## Armor Class (AC)

Armor Class (AC) is a value that determines how easy it is to hit the target.
- AC starts at 10.
- AC decreases when you get better armor. So, the lower the AC is, the better your Armor Class is.
- AC below 0 also provides damage reduction for players.
- AC can go even as low as -100 (or even lower) with certain equipment setups.
- AC calculations are different for player characters and monsters.

For exact formulas involving AC, please visit the [Armor Class entry in the NetHack wiki](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Armor_class).

## Magic Cancellation (MC)

Magic Cancellation (MC) determines how easy it is to inflict a certain magical or semi-magical effect on the target.
- MC starts at 0.
- MC increases when your resistance to these attacks improves. So, the higher the MC is, the better the resistance.
- MC usually varies between 0 and 25.
