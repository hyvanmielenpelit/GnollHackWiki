## Overview

There are six types of fountains in GnollHack:
1. Magic fountain — The fountain from NetHack
2. Fountain of healing
3. Fountain of mana
4. Fountain of power
5. Fountain of poison
6. Fountain of spring water

You can identify a fountain by dipping a potion into it. A fountain of healing, mana, power, and poison will auto-identify. If the potion dilutes, it can be either a magic fountain or a fountain of spring water.

## Magic Fountain

This the [same fountain as in NetHack](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Fountain). However, some of the worse effects can happen only on lower dungeon levels.

## Fountain of Healing

### Drinking

1. If wounded, cures 30–50% of max hit points.
2. If at max health, increases maximum hit points by 1d2.

### Potion Alchemy

When dipped into the fountain:
1. A [[/Items/potion of gain energy]] becomes a [[/Items/potion of extra-healing]].
2. A [[/Items/potion of extra-energy]] becomes a [[/Items/potion of greater healing]].
3. A [[/Items/potion of greater energy]] becomes a [[/Items/potion of full healing]].
4. A [[/Items/potion of full energy]] becomes a [[/Items/potion of full healing]].
5. Any potion of healing — No change.

## Dipping for Excalibur

You can dip a long sword into a magic fountain, and there's a 1/4 chance that the sword is converted into [[/Artifacts/Excalibur]]. This requires, however, that you are lawful and at least experience level 5.

## Diluting Potions

Because of the different types of fountains, it is not as easy to dilute potions in GnollHack as it is in NetHack. However, you can utilize the following methods to dilute your potions:
- Use the sink. You can now dip potions into it to dilute them.
- If you find the fountain of spring water, it has abundance of water to dilute potions and blanking scrolls.

Also, you can buy item blessing from a priest, and therefore you do not need to produce as many [[potions of holy water|/Items/potion of water]] as you need in NetHack.
