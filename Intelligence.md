## Overview

Intelligence raises your [[maximum mana]] and the chance of success to cast certain [[spells]].

## Intelligence-Based Spell Schools

Each point of intelligence gives +15% casting success to the following spell schools:

- [[Abjuration spells]]
- [[Arcane spells]]
- [[Conjuration spells]]
- [[Divination spells]]
- [[Enchantment spells]]
- [[Movement spells]]
- [[Transmutation spells]]

Some of these spell schools use also one or two other attribute scores and take the highest of them when calculating the chance to successfully cast a spell. See [[spell casting]] for more information.
