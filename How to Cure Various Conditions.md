## Mummy Rot


You can contract mummy rot from mummies in the game. If their melee attack bypasses your [Magic Cancellation](https://github.com/hyvanmielenpelit/GnollHack/wiki/Resistances-and-Saving-Throws#4-magic-cancellation), you contract the mummy rot. It can be cured like any other disease in the game.

- Eat a [[fig]] _(cures disease)_
- Use a [[jar of medicinal salve]]
- Cast a [[cure sickness]] spell
- Pray _(if it is safe to pray)_
- Apply a noncursed [[unicorn horn]]
- Talk to a priest and ask for cure sickness
- Quaff a blessed [[potion of healing]], or a blessed [[potion of extra healing]], or a noncursed [[potion of greater healing]], or a noncursed [[potion of full healing]]
- Any other means that cures a disease in the game


## Stoning/Petrification


When a [[cockatrice]] touches you and its attack bypasses your [Magic Cancellation](https://github.com/hyvanmielenpelit/GnollHack/wiki/Resistances-and-Saving-Throws#4-magic-cancellation), you will quickly turn to stone. You have exactly one turn time to cure the condition. It can be cured as follows:

- Eat a [[lizard corpse]]
- Eat a [[dragon fruit]]
- Use a [[jar of basilisk blood]]
- Pray _(if it is safe to pray)_

These will convey you also a 13-turn stoning resistance. Because you need to act quickly when the stoning occurs, most players keep a [[lizard corpse]] or a [[dragon fruit]] in open inventory when playing the game.

Note that once the stoning process has started putting on an item that protects you from petrification, such as an [[amulet versus petrification]], does not protect you from being petrified. 


## Blindness


- Eat a [[carrot]]
- Apply a noncursed [[unicorn horn]]
- Quaff a blessed [[potion of healing]], or a blessed [[potion of extra healing]], or a noncursed [[potion of greater healing]], or a noncursed [[potion of full healing]]
- Cast a [[cure blindness]] spell
- Wait — Blindness is never permanent in GnollHack, so you can wait some time and it will time out.
- Pray _(if it is safe to pray)_ — This can be overkill for curing blindness.


## Lycanthropy


- Eat a [[sprig of wolfsbane]] *(but beware, it's poisonous)*
- Drink a potion of holy water *(it's a blessed [[potion of water]])*
- Pray *(if it is safe to pray)*


## Sliming


- Zap yourself with a [[wand of fire]]
- Read a [[scroll of fire]]
- Step into a fire trap
- Cast a fiery spell at yourself
- Be damaged by a fire attack
- Cast a [[cure sickness]] spell at yourself
- Eat a [[fig]]
- Wear an [[amulet of unchanging]]
- Pray *(only outside Gehennom, and only if it is safe to pray)*


## Polymorph (Self)


- You will return back to your normal form when your hit points go to 0.
- You can cancel yourself with a [[wand of cancellation]].


## Polymorph (Pet)


- You can cancel your pet with a [[wand of cancellation]] to return it to its normal form.
