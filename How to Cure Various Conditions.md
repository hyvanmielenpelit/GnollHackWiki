## Mummy Rot

You can contract mummy rot from mummies in the game. If their melee attack bypasses your [[Magic Cancellation|Resistances and Saving Throws#4-magic-cancellation]], you contract the mummy rot. It can be cured like any other disease in the game.

- Eat a [[/Items/fig]] _(cures disease)_
- Use a [[/Items/jar of medicinal salve]]
- Cast a [[/Spells/cure sickness]] spell
- Pray _(if it is safe to pray)_
- Apply a noncursed [[/Items/unicorn horn]]
- Talk to a priest and ask for cure sickness
- Quaff a blessed [[/Items/potion of healing]], or a blessed [[/Items/potion of extra-healing]], or a noncursed [[/Items/potion of greater healing]], or a noncursed [[/Items/potion of full healing]]
- Any other means that cures a disease in the game

## Stoning/Petrification

When a [[/Monsters/cockatrice]] touches you and its attack bypasses your [[Magic Cancellation|Resistances and Saving Throws#4-magic-cancellation]], you will quickly turn to stone. You have exactly one turn time to cure the condition. It can be cured as follows:

- Eat a [[/Monsters/lizard]] corpse
- Eat a [[/Items/dragon fruit]]
- Use a [[/Items/jar of basilisk blood]]
- Pray _(if it is safe to pray)_

These will convey you also a 13-turn stoning resistance. Because you need to act quickly when the stoning occurs, most players keep a [[/Monsters/lizard]] corpse or a [[/Items/dragon fruit]] in open inventory when playing the game.

Note that once the stoning process has started putting on an item that protects you from petrification, such as an [[/Items/amulet versus petrification]], does not protect you from being petrified. 

## Blindness

- Eat a [[/Items/carrot]]
- Apply a noncursed [[/Items/unicorn horn]]
- Quaff a blessed [[/Items/potion of healing]], or a blessed [[/Items/potion of extra-healing]], or a noncursed [[/Items/potion of greater healing]], or a noncursed [[/Items/potion of full healing]]
- Cast a [[/Spells/cure blindness]] spell
- Wait — Blindness is never permanent in GnollHack, so you can wait some time and it will time out.
- Pray _(if it is safe to pray)_ — This can be overkill for curing blindness.

## Lycanthropy

- Eat a [[/Items/sprig of wolfsbane]] *(but beware, it's poisonous)*
- Drink a potion of holy water *(it's a blessed [[/Items/potion of water]])*
- Pray *(if it is safe to pray)*

## Sliming

- Zap yourself with a [[/Items/wand of fire]]
- Read a [[/Items/scroll of fire]]
- Step into a fire trap
- Cast a fiery spell at yourself
- Be damaged by a fire attack
- Cast a [[/Spells/cure sickness]] spell at yourself
- Eat a [[/Items/fig]]
- Wear an [[/Items/amulet of unchanging]]
- Pray *(only outside Gehennom, and only if it is safe to pray)*

## Polymorph (Self)

- You will return back to your normal form when your hit points go to 0.
- You can cancel yourself with a [[/Items/wand of cancellation]].

## Polymorph (Pet)

- You can cancel your pet with a [[/Items/wand of cancellation]] to return it to its normal form.
