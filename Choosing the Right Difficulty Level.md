## Difficulty Levels

GnollHack has 7 [[difficulty levels]]:

* [[Standard]] — You are new to GnollHack
* [[Experienced]] — You have some experience with GnollHack
* [[Adept]] — You are averagely experienced in GnollHack
* [[Veteran]] — You have lots of experience with GnollHack
* [[Expert]] – You are expert at GnollHack — _This is equivalent to NetHack difficulty_
* [[Master]] — You are a GnollHack professional
* [[Grand Master|Grand Master (Difficulty)]] — You are a GnollHack professional looking for ultimate challenge

### New Players

If you are new to GnollHack and NetHack, we recommend starting with the **[[Standard]] difficulty**. However, if you are not new to the roguelike genre, you can choose a higher difficulty. Note that lower difficulties give you gameplay hints, which can be useful for learning the game.

### NetHack Veterans

If you are a NetHack veteran but new to GnollHack, we recommend starting with a difficulty between **[[Experienced]]** and **[[Expert]]**. Easier difficulties allow you to learn new mechanics and mitigate some of the additional hardships that come from not being familiar with them. Even though the **[[Expert]] difficulty** has an unadjusted combat difficulty, it can feel more intense than NetHack especially in the end game. Therefore, starting with one of the easier difficulties can be a good choice until you become familiar with the new mechanics in GnollHack.

### NetHack Masters

For people, who have mastered NetHack and have multiple ascensions, we recommend starting with the **[[Expert]]** difficulty and after getting used to the game moving up to the **[[Master]]** and **[[Grand Master|Grand Master (Difficulty)]]** difficulty.

## Minimum Difficulty
