* [[/Difficulties/Experienced]] — You have some experience with GnollHack
* [[/Difficulties/Adept]] — You are averagely experienced in GnollHack
* [[/Difficulties/Veteran]] — You have lots of experience with GnollHack

* [[/Difficulties/Grand Master]] — You are a GnollHack professional looking for ultimate challenge

### New Players

If you are new to GnollHack and NetHack, we recommend starting with the **[[/Difficulties/Standard]] difficulty**. However, if you are not new to the roguelike genre, you can choose a higher difficulty. Note that lower difficulties give you gameplay hints, which can be useful for learning the game.

### NetHack Veterans

If you are a NetHack veteran but new to GnollHack, we recommend starting with a difficulty between **[[/Difficulties/Experienced]]** and **[[/Difficulties/Expert]]**. Easier difficulties allow you to learn new mechanics and mitigate some of the additional hardships that come from not being familiar with them. Even though the **[[/Difficulties/Expert]] difficulty** has an unadjusted combat difficulty, it can feel more intense than NetHack especially in the end game. Therefore, starting with one of the easier difficulties can be a good choice until you become familiar with the new mechanics in GnollHack.

### NetHack Masters

For people, who have mastered NetHack and have multiple ascensions, we recommend starting with the **[[/Difficulties/Expert]]** difficulty and after getting used to the game moving up to the **[[/Difficulties/Master]]** and **[[/Difficulties/Grand Master]]** difficulty.
