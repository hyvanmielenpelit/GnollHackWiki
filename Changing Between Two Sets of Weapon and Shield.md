You have two sets of right hand and left hand items that you can ready. A usual setup is to have a melee weapon and a shield in one set and a ranged weapon in the second set.

## Using Swap Command

You can change between the sets by using **Swap** command (the keyboard command is 'x'). It will not take a turn for you to do so.

## Using Handedness Command

Sometimes you have a situation where you have a weapon and a shield in one set and another single hand weapon, such as a sling, in another set, and you want to use the same shield in both sets. In such a case, you can use **Handedness** command (the keyboard command is 'Alt-h') to tell the game that you want to change only the right hand weapon and keep using the left hand shield in both sets.

## Auto-Swap

Mobile versions of GnollHack have an auto-swap feature. If you have two sets of weapons equipped, one for melee and one for ranged combat, the game will automatically change between the sets depending on if the target is in melee range or far away. That is, when you tap on a hostile monster, the player character will automatically attack with the melee weapon a monster that is in the melee range and fire the ranged weapon at a monster which is far away.
