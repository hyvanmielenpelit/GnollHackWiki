For each affix, the wish is successful at 100% chance, except for Elemental Protection, Last Alliance, Banishment, Witch-King's, Olympian, Jotunheimian, and Melnibonean qualities that have 33% chance if you have positive luck (and otherwise 0%); if fails, no affix is gained.

## Artifact Wishing

The probability of getting an artifact through wishing depends on artifacts already generated in the game as follows:

- 2 or fewer artifacts generated: 100%
- 3 or more artifacts generated: $2/n$, where $n$ is the number of already generated artifacts

| Generated artifacts | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
| :---------------------- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Chance | 100% | 100% | 100% | 67% | 50% | 40% | 33% | 29% |
