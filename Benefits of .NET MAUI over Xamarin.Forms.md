WinUI 3 supports both unpackaged apps (EXE) and packaged apps (MSIX), which makes it possible to upload apps created with it to Steam and other stores, which don't support MSIX.

### macOS Platform Support through Mac Catalyst

.NET MAUI supports creating a native macOS client through [Mac Catalyst](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/mac-catalyst).

## Additional Platform Features

### Android

#### Play Asset Delivery

.NET MAUI has native support for [Play Asset Delivery](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/asset-delivery), which is needed when uploading bigger apps to Google Play Store.

## Improved Debugging

### Sentry Support

.NET MAUI supports [Sentry](https://sentry.io), which gathers information about users' crashes. It is super-helpful for debugging your application and seeing what's really going on with various ports.
