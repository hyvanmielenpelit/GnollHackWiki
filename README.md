GnollHack wiki contains the official information about [GnollHack](https://gnollhack.com/), a remastered and enhanced version of [NetHack](https://nethack.org).

GnollHack wiki can be accessed at [https://wiki.gnollhack.com/](https://wiki.gnollhack.com/).

This repository contains the source code for the documentation. It's basically a bunch of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files and images, using GitHub/Gollum-style syntax. You can learn more about the syntax in [Gollum wiki](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki). Most importantly, wikilinks with an alias follow the convention `[[Alias|Page Name]]` instead of `[[Page Name|Alias]]` syntax of MediaWiki.

The wiki is built upon [Gollum wiki software](https://github.com/gollum/gollum).

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to the wiki, please read these instructions: [Editing Wiki with Visual Studio Code](https://wiki.gnollhack.com/Editing%20Wiki%20with%20Visual%20Studio%20Code.md)

Editing the wiki is more heavy-weight than that of normal wikis, since you need to install Git and Visual Studio Code and learn to make pull requests.

To make editing easier, we have our own Visual Studio Code extension called [Foam for Gollum](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Hyvnmielenpelitry.foam-vscode-gollum). You are free to suggest enhancements to it.

## GnollHack Source Code

The source code of GnollHack is available on GitHub in [its own repository](https://github.com/hyvanmielenpelit/GnollHack).
