Charisma gives you discount in shop prices and service fees. It also increases the chance of success to cast certain [[spells]]. Each point of charisma gives +15% casting success to the following spell schools:

- [[Celestial spells]]
- [[Clerical spells]]
- [[Conjuration spells]]
- [[Divination spells]]
- [[Enchantment spells]]
- [[Nature spells]]
- [[Necromancy spells]]
- [[Transmutation spells]]

Some of these spell schools use also one or two other attribute scores and take the highest of them when calculating the chance to successfully cast a spell. See [[spell casting]] for more information.
