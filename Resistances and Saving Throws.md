- **50% or 75% Shock Resistance** — Reduces lightning damage by 50% or 75%, and has a 50% or 75% chance to protect equipment from lightning attacks


## 3. Magic Resistance
Magic Resistance is very important to get in GnollHack, preferably before dungeon level 8, when polymorph traps start to appear. It protects you from the following things:
- Polymorph traps
- Some other polymorph effects *(see below)*
- Anti-magic traps
- Monster spells

Additionally, unique monsters are shielded from *cancellation spells and effects* by Magic Resistance *(see below)*.


### Nerfs to Magic Resistance


Contrary to NetHack, Magic Resistance does not protect you from:
- **Death attacks** — such as the Finger of Death spell, or the wand of death
    - You need *Death Resistance* to be safe from death attacks
- **Magic missiles** — such as the Magic Missile spell, or the wand of magic missile
    - You need *Full Magic Missile Resistance* to be immune to magic missiles
- **Striking** — such as the Force Bolt spell or the wand of striking
    - You need *Full Magic Missile Resistance* to be immune to striking
- **Curses** — Magic Resistance used to halve the effect of incoming curses but it does not do it anymore
    - You need *Curse Resistance* to be immune to cursing


### Chance to Work


If a player gets Magic Resistance from an item, it has always a 100% chance to work.

However, monsters' Magic Resistance has a percentage chance to work. The magic resistance is listed in the monsters' stats.


### Cancellation Attacks and Magic Resistance
**Cancellation attacks** prevent players and monsters from using *spells* and *wands*. 

They can be resisted as follows:
- **Cancellation spell or effect** against a normal monster bypasses magic resistance and has a 100% chance to work. However, unique monsters are still shielded from cancellation by magic resistance.
- **Disjunction spell or effect** bypasses every monster's magic resistance, including unique ones, and thus has always a 100% chance to work.
- **Cancellation attacks against a player**, such as the gaze attack of a gazer, bypass magic resistance and have a 100% chance to work.

Additionally, it is good to remember the following things about cancellation:
- If you zap a [[wand of cancellation]] or cast a *cancellation spell* at yourself or at items, it will set items' beautitude to Uncursed, set the enchantment to +0, make most potions into water, blank scrolls and spellbooks, and set items' charges to 0.
- Putting a [[wand of cancellation]] into a [[bag of holding]] will destroy the bag.


### Polymorph and Magic Resistance


Magic resistance protects from:
- [[Wand of polymorph]] zapped at monsters
- Polymorph traps
- [[Polymorph]] spell cast at monsters
- Polymorph from being hit with a wielded [[potion of polymorph]]

Magic resistance does *not* protect you from:
- Polymorph from [[ring of polymorph]]
- [[Wand of polymorph]] zapped at yourself
- [[Polymorph]] spell cast at yourself
- Polymorph from drinking a [[potion of polymorph]]


## 4. Magic Cancellation
Magic Cancellation protects you from *magical or semi-magical touch attacks*. You get Magic Cancellation (MC) from armor. Contrary to NetHack, it stacks and the effect is on the scale 0–25, which gives you a % chance to resist magical or semi-magical touch attacks. The chance is listed in the status bar. MC protects you from:
- Life drain attacks (which drain an experience level)
- Lycanthropy
- Nymph stealing attacks (but nymphs' attack gives a big penalty to MC, so it has a bigger than normal chance to work)
- Mummy rot
- Paralysis attacks
- Seduction attacks
- Stoning (petrification) touch attacks
- Terminal illness attacks


### Magic Cancellation Chance
The Magic Cancellation formula is the following:
- **0:** 0%
- **1:** 10%
- **2:** 20%
- **3:** 30%
- **4:** 40%
- **5:** 50%
- **6:** 55%
- **7:** 60%
- **8:** 65%
- **9:** 70%
- **10:** 75%
- **11:** 80%
- **12:** 82%
- **13:** 84%
- **14:** 86%
- **15:** 88%
- **16:** 90%
- **17:** 91%
- **18:** 92%
- **19:** 93%
- **20:** 94%
- **21:** 95%
- **22:** 96%
- **23:** 97%
- **24:** 98%
- **25 and above:** 99%


### Modifiers to Magic Cancellation


Monster attacks can incur a bonus or penalty to MC depending on the monster difficulty. Attacks of higher level monsters usually incur more penalty to MC than those of lower level monsters.


### Magic Cancellation from Enchantments


When you enchant an armor, you get +1 MC for every +3 enchantment. Therefore, it is very useful to enchant armor to at least +3. The same rule applies to divine protection that you can buy from a priest NPC by making a major contribution to the temple.


### Intelligence Drain Attacks
Magic Cancellation does *not* protect you from the **intelligence drain attacks of tentacled ones**. Instead, you need a helmet to block 90% of these attacks. Additionally, you can wear a [[nose ring of cerebral safeguarding]] or a [[ring of sustain ability]] to become immune to the intelligence drain attacks.

Note that the intelligence drain attacks also cause *amnesia*, which makes you forget items' identification, spells, and the layout of dungeon levels.


## 5. Wisdom-Based Saving Throw
Contrary to NetHack, charm, sleep, and other mind-affecting spells and effects, such as fear, do not check against the magic resistance of monsters. Instead, monsters need to make a wisdom-based saving throw to resist the effect. The chance of resisting is equal to:

`-30% + 5% x Wisdom`

Thus, a monster with Wisdom 10 has a 20% chance of resisting and a monster with Wisdom 20 has a 70% chance of resisting such a spell or effect.

Spells cast with the Skilled or higher spell school skill incur a -15% penalty to the wisdom-based saving throw per skill level above Basic. A spell cast at an Unskilled skill level incurs a +15% bonus to the wisdom-based saving throw.

Blessed items with mind-affecting effects, such a blessed [[scroll of taming]] or a blessed [[wand of sleep]], incur a -25% penalty to the wisdom-based saving throw. Similarly, cursed items with mind-affecting effects – if there is no separate cursed effect – such as is the case with a cursed [[wand of sleep]], incur a +25% bonus to the wisdom-based saving throw.


## 6. Constitution-Based Saving Throw


Some spells, such as Power Words, check against the constitution of the target. The chance of resisting is:

`-30% + 5% x Constitution`

Thus, a monster with Constitution 10 has a 20% chance of resisting and a monster with Constitution 20 has a 70% chance of resisting such a spell or effect.

Spells cast with the Skilled or higher spell school skill incur a -15% penalty to the constitution-based saving throw per skill level above Basic. A spell cast at an Unskilled skill level incurs a +15% bonus to the constitution-based saving throw.


## 7. Reflection


Reflection gives a complete immunity to ray attacks, such as most wands and dragon breath. The rays reflect back to the caster.


## Advice on Getting Resistances


Generally, *magic resistance* and *reflection* are considered most important to get for a player. However, *poison resistance*, *sleep resistance*, *free action*, and *death resistance* are generally very important as well, because they can shield you from some insta-death attacks and situations. Additionally, *drain resistance* is important against some level-draining undead.

Full elemental resistances are also useful against some item-destruction effects (such as shocking spheres) but are generally not considered as must-haves.
