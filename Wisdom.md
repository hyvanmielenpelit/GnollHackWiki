Wisdom raises your [[maximum mana]] and the chance of success to cast certain [[spells]]. Each point of wisdom gives +15% casting success to the following spell schools:

- [[Abjuration spells]]
- [[Celestial spells]]
- [[Clerical spells]]
- [[Divination spells]]
- [[Healing spells]]
- [[Movement spells]]
- [[Nature spells]]
- [[Necromancy spells]]
- [[Transmutation spells]]

Some of these spell schools use also one or two other attribute scores and take the highest of them when calculating the chance to successfully cast a spell. See [[spell casting]] for more information.
