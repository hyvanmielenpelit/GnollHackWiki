## Notes
- (W) indicates 33% of chance to obtain the affix when wished for if luck is nonnegative, and otherwise 0%.
- **Cyclopean**, **Olympian**, and **Jotunheimian** prefixes stack with the weapon quality modifiers (exceptional, elite, celestial/primordial/infernal) in a linear fashion. These prefixes add +2 to the *base damage multiplier* while the quality modifiers add +1/+2/+3 to the *base damage multiplier*. Thus, a Cyclopean elite weapon deals 5x base damage (1+2+2=5).
- Mythic affixes cannot appear on double-headed and triple-headed flails.
