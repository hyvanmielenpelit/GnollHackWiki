## Background


GnollHack captures all key presses by default. To allow keys to function for other applications they must be unblocked by the developer.


## Hotkeys Available for 3rd Party Applications


GnollHack allows **F1â€“F12** to be used as hotkeys for 3rd party applications. They are not captured by the game.


### Exceptions


- **Alt+F4** attempts to close the game.


## System Keys


We have allowed several system keys to function normally:

- **Alt+Tab** changes the window.
- Key combinations using the **Win key** are unblocked, which means that you can use, for example, Win+Shift+S to take screenshots.
