In GnollHack, a weapon can have a quality modifier. The quality modifier increases the weapon's base damage.
- **Exceptional** weapons deal 2x base damage
- **Elite** weapons deal 3x base damage
- **Celestial/Primordial/Infernal** weapons deal 4x base damage but can be used only by lawful/neutral/chaotic beings, respectively.

For example, a normal long sword deals 1d8 damage to small creatures and 1d12 to large creatures, while an exceptional long sword deals 2d8 damage to small creatures and 2d12 to large creatures.
