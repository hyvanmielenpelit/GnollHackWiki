In GnollHack, shields give more AC bonus than in NetHack:

- **Small shields:** -2 AC
- **Medium shields:** -3 AC

- [[Items/Elven shield]]
- [[Items/Great orcish shield]]
- [[Items/Orcish shield]]
- [[Items/Large shield]]

All non-magical shields can be mythic or legendary.

## Magical Shields

- [[Items/Shield of reflection]]

Magical shields *cannot* be mythic or legendary.

## Weapon-Shields

- [[Items/Spiked shield]]
- [[Items/Spiked silver shield]]

Weapon-shields can be mythic or legendary.

## Armor Quality

All shields, including the [[Items/shield of reflection]], can be exceptional, elite, or celestial/primordial/infernal.

- **Exceptional:** -3 AC, +1 MC
- **Elite:** -6 AC, +2 MC
- **Celestial/Primordial/Infernal:** -9 AC, +3 MC, but can be used only by lawful/neutral/chaotic beings.

On weapon-shields, the armor quality also multiplies the base damage:

- **Exceptional:** Double base damage
- **Elite:** Triple base damage
- **Celestial/Primordial/Infernal:** Quadruple base damage, but can be used only by lawful/neutral/chaotic beings.
