## Overview

GnollHack is actively developed for **Android**, **iOS**, and **Windows** using a modern **.NET MAUI** codebase. Legacy versions of the game (such as Xamarin.Forms and native Win32/ASCII clients) are deprecated and no longer active.

Here is a quick directory of key design and structure documentation:

* [[Repository Structure]] — ℹ️ **Easy to digest:** Visualizes how C core and C# MAUI code interact.
* [[Related Repositories]] — ℹ️ **Easy to digest:** List of dependencies and sub-repositories.

## Modern Client Development (.NET MAUI)

This is the primary technology stack for GnollHack development. It compiles a single C# codebase targeting mobile and desktop platforms.

> 📢 **Important:** If you are new to the codebase, **you must read this first**:
> - **[[Overview of Building GnollHack with .NET MAUI]]** — ⚠️ **Requires time to digest:** Explains how the native C library, the C# wrapper, and build-time tools interact. Skipping this is the #1 reason developers struggle to build the game.

### Essential Guides & Setup

These files contain complex development instructions that may require some time to digest:

* [[Instructions for Developing GnollHackM Project (.NET MAUI)]]
* [[Updating Tileset for GnollHackM (.NET MAUI)]] — ⚠️ **Complex:** Details the SkiaSharp tile display pipeline.
* [[Known Working Build Setups]]

> 💡 **Tip:** Before setting up your machine, check the [[Known Working Build Setups]] to ensure your OS and SDK versions match a verified configuration.

### Modern Client Build Instructions

Detailed, step-by-step guides for compiling the modern application:

* **Windows:** [[Build Instructions for WinUI3 Version on Windows (.NET MAUI)]]
* **Android:** [[Build Instructions for Android Version on Windows (.NET MAUI)]]
* **iOS:** [[Build Instructions for iOS Version on Windows (.NET MAUI)]]

> ⚠️ **Warning (Common Pitfall):** Ensure that the .NET MAUI workload is fully installed inside Visual Studio. Missing platform workloads (Android/iOS) will cause project loading errors.

### Troubleshooting & Technical Reference

* [[Troubleshooting Building GnollHack with .NET MAUI]] — **Pitfalls:** Covers Xamarin-to-MAUI SDK issues, MSBuild path conflicts, and keystore errors.
* [[Data File Locations (WinUI 3 Version – .NET MAUI)]] — **Easy:** Shows where settings and save files are saved.
* [[System Requirements for Modern Windows Port (.NET MAUI ∕ WinUI 3)]]
* [[CPU and GPU Usage Modes in Modern Windows Port (.NET MAUI ∕ WinUI 3)]]

### Publishing Checklist

* [[Steam Version Publishing Checklist]] — ⚠️ **Complex:** Covers codesigning, packaging, and Steamworks integration.
* [[Installing MSIX Packages on Windows 10 and 11]] — **Easy:** For testing local builds outside of Steam.

## Modern Client Supported Platforms

The table below summarizes support for the modern client. Note that emulator performance varies, and platform support is subject to CPU architecture availability.

| Platform | Technology | CPU Arch | Solution | Projects | Emulator Support<sup>1</sup> |
|:---------|:-----------|:---------|:---------|:---------|:----------------------------:|
| Android | .NET MAUI | Arm64, x64<sup>2</sup> | GnollHackM | GnollHackM | Yes<sup>4</sup> |
| iOS | .NET MAUI | Arm64 | GnollHackM | GnollHackM | Yes<sup>4</sup> |
| Windows | .NET MAUI | x64, (Arm64<sup>3</sup>) | GnollHackM | GnollHackM | No<sup>5</sup> |

- <sup>1</sup> Emulator support refers to whether the port is supported by popular cross-operating-system emulators.
- <sup>2</sup> Android x64 binaries are used by Android emulators running on a Windows machine with an x64 CPU, such as the Google Play Games for PC emulator.
- <sup>3</sup> .NET MAUI supports Arm64 on Windows but we have not built Arm64 binaries, because we do not have a Windows test device with an Arm64 CPU.
- <sup>4</sup> May have odd behavior or crash.
- <sup>5</sup> GnollHack's modern Windows port (.NET MAUI) doesn't run on Wine or Proton, because they don't have support for running WinUI 3 apps.

### Future Platform Support

- Support for **macOS** using **.NET MAUI / Mac Catalyst** or **Avalonia UI** is planned for the future, but it may take a while.
- **Linux** support for the modern client is planned using **Avalonia UI**, pending maturity of the technology stack.
- At the moment, we do not plan to support *gaming consoles* or *controllers* (such as Steam Deck).
