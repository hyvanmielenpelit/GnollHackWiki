## Modern Windows


When using the modern Windows port, you need to enable **Save File Tracking** in the settings before you can enable **Server Posting**. Save File Tracking tracks that:

1. Your saved games are loaded only once.
2. Your save files are not modified.

This should make *save scumming* impossible.


## Android and iOS


On Android and iOS, enabling **Save File Tracking** does nothing at the moment.
